## 5. 🏗️ The Architect's Blueprint (MVP Spec)
### **Project Name:** UI Rift
> *Spot UI changes before they slow you down.*

**marketing Hook (Hero Text):**
`Stop guessing. Start knowing. Track every UI change automatically.`

**Core Features (MVP):**
- [ ] Website/URL Monitoring: Users can add specific web pages (e.g., app settings pages) for automated, periodic snapshots.
- [ ] Visual Difference Highlighting: Side-by-side comparison of current and previous page states, visually highlighting all detected UI changes.
- [ ] Customizable Snapshot Frequency: Users can define how often each monitored page is checked for updates (e.g., daily, hourly).
- [ ] Change History Log: A chronological record of all detected changes for each monitored page, with links to the visual diffs.
- [ ] Email Notifications for Detected Changes: Users receive an alert when a significant change is found on a monitored page.

**Recommended Stack:**
`Frontend: React (with a simple UI library like Chakra UI or Material-UI for rapid development) | Backend: Node.js (with Express.js for REST API) | Database: PostgreSQL (for storing URLs, snapshot metadata, and user data) | Screenshotting & DOM Capture: Puppeteer (for Node.js, to programmatically take screenshots and capture DOM structure) | Image/DOM Diffing: Resemble.js or a custom DOM comparison logic (to identify visual and structural differences)`

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to easily add and configure web pages (like specific settings menus) to monitor for UI changes, so I'm always informed.
- As a user, I want to visually see exactly what specific elements or sections have changed between snapshots, so I can quickly understand the impact.
- As a user, I want to be notified promptly via email when a monitored page undergoes a significant UI change, so I'm never caught off guard.
- As a user, I want to access a clear historical record of all detected changes, so I can track UI evolution over time or pinpoint when a specific option moved.
- As a user, I want to quickly find specific UI elements or settings that have moved or disappeared, to avoid frustration and wasted time.
